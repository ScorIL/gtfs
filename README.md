# GTFS

This library allows you to parse GTFS folders into a hierarchy of structs representing the
[available GTFS data types](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference). It's
currently a work in progress. I've only implmented as much as I need for now.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add gtfs to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:gtfs, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end
